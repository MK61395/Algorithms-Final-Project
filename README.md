# FAST Social Network Project

## Executive Summary

The FAST Social Network project aimed to design and implement a C++ program modeling and analyzing a social network within the FAST-NUCES university setting. Using graph algorithms, the focus was on representing relationships between students, faculty, and staff to gain insights into the social structure. The team comprised Muhammad Kashif, Bilal Saleem, Usman Nazeer, and Muhammad Huzaifa, each contributing expertise in different aspects of graph algorithms and analysis.
